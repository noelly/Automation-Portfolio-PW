  subtitle: 'Lots of V-Series Blackwing owners track their cars. Cadillac’s new Precision Package of chassis hardware and software mods is for them.',
  body: 'Cadillac reckons that a higher percentage of its Blackwing owners regularly take their toys to track days than can be said of folks purchasing BMW M and Mercedes-AMG cars. And when Alex MacDonald transitioned from his job as vehicle performance manager overseeing Corvette and Camaro to become chief engineer of the CT4 and CT5 two years ago, his team implored him to put a skunkworks track-optimized chassis package it had been working on into production. That hard-edged concept, originally demonstrated on a CT4, will indeed come to market on the 2025 Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing as the Precision Package, RPO V8V, in early 2025.The Goal of RPO V8VThe CT5-V Blackwing is already amazingly capable on the road, offering either supple luxury or sharp-edged response on demand with a flick of a drive-mode switch. But kit one out for track duty in the latest time-attack rubber, and it bumped up against the limits of what’s possible with a road-optimized setup. The goal of the Precision Package, therefore, was to extend the capability envelop in that direction—"to improve path precision and increase corner speeds.” Or as executive chief engineer Brandon Vivian puts it, “We built this vehicle to set records on some of toughest tracks around the world and reward the most discerning driving enthusiast.”(Note that the powertrain remains unchanged.)',
